# Excursion: Expedia Redesign 
## DH150 User Experience Design
## Priyana Patel 

## About the Project 
The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with travel planning. The target community is a community of travelers that seek adventure, travel to new places, spend time with friends and family, and never feel settled in one place. These users are a group of people with long, drawn-out network ties in multiple cities, countries, and continents looking to explore. 

## Design Statement
How can mobile technology enhance the decision-making challenges of travel booking, while valuing ease of use and cost-effectiveness? 
Target users value ease of use, previous customer satisfaction, and cost-efficient travel options. Additionally, they prefer a desktop travel user experience over a mobile travel user experience. 

## Competitor Analysis
There are many travel booking apps and available for users however the leading service in aesthetic community while providing ease of use are Expedia and Southwest. [read more...](https://priyanapatel57.github.io/DH150-UX/assignment01/)

## User Research 
The basic need involved for travel planning is self-actualization. The concept of traveling is to accomplish a goal; such as to explore a new place or visit family or friends.The current solution to book travel plans is to meet in person with a travel agent or book directly with the airline and hotel, via their phone line or website.The limitations that can possibly be improved with digital technology are the visualization of options, individualized to the user's preferences, such as price points, travel times, and relative locations. Additionally, technology can help narrow search choices based on these preferences to help the user book a trip more efficiently.

I conducted a user interview for a target user, asking them to complete several tasks on their mobile device to search for travel-related information. The interview process directs the user to search for the average price of hotel in Los Angeles and a last minute flight to San Francisco.

## UX Storytelling 
Based on my user research, I created three user personas, empathy maps, and user journey maps.

I suggested **three features** to solve user difficulties associated with each persona and paired them with **three scenarios**

||Magdalena|Armani|Emma|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Feature|Price Tool - suggests what details of your trip to change (such as travel dates, location, airport) in order to fit a designated budget and price range|Minimized Booking Process - compares all airlines and websites and arranges flights by price visibility with personal recommendations, takes user directly to checkout after selecting flights|Recommendation Tool - Summarizes main points of customer reviews, shows highly recommended|
|Scenario|Search for cost-efficient bundle deals|Search for last-minute flight deals and book efficiently|Search for high-rated hotels in good locations|

See each user's journey through the given scenario [here](https://priyanapatel57.github.io/DH150-UX/assignment05/)

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation 

I decided to explore Expedia's user interface and logo colors, Dark Midnight Blue (#00355F) and Deep Lemon (#EEC218). I used color.adobe.com to explore complementary, analagous, and monochromatic variations of Midgnight Blue. I also explored color palettes related to keywords such as "travel","explore" and "adventure". 

See how I explored different web color schemes [here](https://priyanapatel57.github.io/DH150-UX/assignment07/)

I created wireframes to support the following tasks: input search field, select an inbound flight, select an outbound flight, select a hotel, pay for and book the trip. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and flow of these features integrated with the current process of booking a trip on a mobile travel app.

I tested my wireflow to check for any confusions or unexpected interactions from the user:
