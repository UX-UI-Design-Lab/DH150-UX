# Community of Travelers and Aventure-Seekers

## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Priyana Patel

The community that I feel I belong to is a community that seeks adventure, travels to new places, spends time with friends and family, and never feels settled in one place. I feel a close association with this community because as an immigrant from the United Kingdom, I call multiple places home. 

The app that I chose to best represent this community is Expedia. (relate to community - travelers, families, business, people with long network ties). Expedia is an online travel agency that can be used to book flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and bundle deals.

## Expedia App Heuristic Evaluation

https://www.expedia.com/app

Overall, I feel that Expedia provides a relatively straightforward, step-by-step process to plan the user's trip however (confusion for new users).The main UX issues I found that can be improved are: too much text/overcrowding on the page, too much scrolling, and confusion with fine print details such as baggage fees, layovers, check-in age, etc. 

## 1: Visibility of system status
Shows each step everytime the page loads (step 1: select hotel, step 2: select outbound flight, step 3: select inbound flight) <br />
Severity rating: 2 <br />
Why: The user is only able to see their progress when they are in-between steps and the next page is loading)

## **2: Match between system and the real world**
Good use of icons* <br />
Severity rating: 1 <br />
Why: Expedia does a satisfactory job of using language that the user can understand and implementing icons that match the real world, such as a luggage icon.

## **3: User control and freedom**
Upper pulldown bar to edit search field <br />
Once on the final checkout page, the user has to keep clicking the back arrow to change one leg of the flight <br />
The user is only able to book airline tickets for a maximum of 6 people <br />
Severity rating: 2 <br />
Why: There are a few restrictions on user freedom that limit how much information is visible to the user, however, they do not severely prevent the user as they go through each step to the final checkout page. 

## **4: Consistency and standards**
Text or icons in blue are actionable items, red items are used when a feature is not available (non-refundable), green items are used when a feature is available (free cancellation) <br />
The flight search field is almost the exact same as the bundle search field, creating ambiguity <br />
Severity rating: 1 <br />
Why: Expedia does a satsifactory job of using consistent colors for actionable items and feature availability; it is clear for the user which items on the page to click on to continue the flow.

## **5: Error prevention** 
Once on the overview page before checkout, if a user tries to exit, a warning message appears asking if their would like to start a new search (reminding them that their current package will be cleared) <br />
In the search field, there is no message for the user if they forget to fill out a field, such as "Flying to"; the search button remains unhighlighted <br />
Severity rating: 2 <br />
Why: Expedia does a satsifactory job of prevention errors in the user flow, however, it is easy for the user to be unaware of what they are doing wrong if they fill out the search field incorrectly.

## **6: Recognition rather than recall**
The menu bar has a list of options that the user can search for, allowing the user to recognize which service they are looking for <br />
The most recent search field is saved, however there is no "search history" for all searches <br />
Severity rating: <br />
Why:

## **7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
For flight search, the user has to select their class preference, limited their ability to see options for multiple classes at the same time <br />
To book a cruise, the user is directed from the app to the desktop site <br />
The user does not have an option to save their search result for later viewing <br />
Severity rating: <br />
Why: 

## **8: Aesthetic and minimalistic design**
Severity rating: <br />
Why: <br />

## **9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
If a user mispells a destination, a dropdown list of destinations appear and they must click one of those to proceed <br />
Severity rating: 2 <br />
Why: The app does not provide details on how the user can solve or rectify their mistake; they are left to figure it out on their own

## **10: Help and documentation**
Not being sure which airport to pick when typing in a city for a flight <br />
Information icons for flight class and baggage fees appear after a flight is selected (not before the user fills out the search field) <br />
Severity rating: 2 <br />
Why: While Expedia provides help in a timely manner during the selection process, there are a lot of details that are unclear when a user is first entering their search.
