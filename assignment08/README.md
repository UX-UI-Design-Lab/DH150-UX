**Feedback
*In-class cognitive walkthrough*
The main feedback I received was on my "progress bar"; it was unclear what "step 1, step 2, etc." referred to. I was advised by my peers to either replace it with a visual progress bar that fills up with the completion of each step or replace the text with flight and hotel icons.

My peers additionally said it would be helpful to rename my "price tool" feature. It was unclear that clicking the button navigated to the corresponding page titled "Edit to Find More Options". The user actions and the intended feature are not consistent with each other. One user actually thought that the frame where you can use a slider to change the travel budget was the intended flow and next page. My peers told me to include the travel budget field on the same page as the search query, providing a default option of the cheapest and most expensive options as the price range.

Regarding the flight filter page, my peers said that it would be helpful to clarify "morning, afternoon, evening" because it is unclear what a midnight flight would fall under. All in all, the terms I used are a little vague and broad, and so I plan to include specific times of the day under each term. Lastly, they said that it is confusing and overwhelming to include both the departure and arrival flight search results on the same page. While this is an issue I tried to overcome, I plan on re-organizing the page through two carousels as opposed to two vertical scrolling sections.
