# Assignment 08: Interactive Prototype

DH150: User Experience Design 

## Project Description
The following interactive prototype is designed to solve and illustrate three features to ease travel-planning. The three features include a price tool that clearly points out how to adjust your search to find options within your price range, a minimized flight booking process which allows you to select both inbound and outbound flights on the same page, without unecessary text and details, and a recommendation tool which allows you to sort through hotel reviews by each user, personalizing the selection process while eliminating the feeling of being overwhelmed. 

The prototype was created using Figma, a browser based UI and UX application for prototyping and code-generating. I have utilized Figma for past projects for creating wireframes for mobile applications and websites. I first started by digitizing my paper wireframes while implementing graphic and interactive components. I ensured that the color scheme fits with the intention of the project: to book

## Graphic Interface 
As this design closely follow Expedia's mobile app with the implementation of three new features, I decided to adopt the travel agency's clear, structural layout and great use of icons. Expedia's logo colors are Dark Midnight Blue (#00355F) and Deep Lemon (#EEC218). I used color.adobe.com to explore complementary, analagous, and monochromatic variations of Midgnight Blue. I also explored color palettes related to keywords such as "travel","explore" and "adventure". Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design (ex. Color scheme). The final interactice prototype implements a monochromatic color palette of Midnight Blue with White.

## Feedback
*In-class cognitive walkthrough*
The main feedback I received was on my "progress bar"; it was unclear what "step 1, step 2, etc." referred to. I was advised by my peers to either replace it with a visual progress bar that fills up with the completion of each step or replace the text with flight and hotel icons.

My peers additionally said it would be helpful to rename my "price tool" feature. It was unclear that clicking the button navigated to the corresponding page titled "Edit to Find More Options". The user actions and the intended feature are not consistent with each other. One user actually thought that the frame where you can use a slider to change the travel budget was the intended flow and next page. My peers told me to include the travel budget field on the same page as the search query, providing a default option of the cheapest and most expensive options as the price range.

Regarding the flight filter page, my peers said that it would be helpful to clarify "morning, afternoon, evening" because it is unclear what a midnight flight would fall under. All in all, the terms I used are a little vague and broad, and so I plan to include specific times of the day under each term. Lastly, they said that it is confusing and overwhelming to include both the departure and arrival flight search results on the same page. While this is an issue I tried to overcome, I plan on re-organizing the page through two carousels as opposed to two vertical scrolling sections.

First Impression: "LOVE THE COLORS AND INTERFACE - very clear and easy to read"
"Very big buttons and clear about what they do"
"Was not able to move the travel budget scroller but wasn’t sure if that was part of your features"
"Price tool was clear and easy to use and understand"
"Maybe enlarge “Back to search results” so it is a little easier to see?"
"LOVE the scrolling on top of the screen - very convenient" 
"Reviews were easy to navigate" 
"Filter is clear and love that when I click on the button it will shade to show that I have selected it"
"Love that there is an edit in checkout so I can go back whenever I want to"

*Personal Suggestions*
Confirmation page, more information for flight, edit color palette so that each pair achieves a high colo contrast score, especially for small text
