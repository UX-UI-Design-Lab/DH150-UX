## *DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Priyana Patel* 

### The community that I feel I belong to is a community that seeks adventure, travels to new places, spends time with friends and family, and never feels settled in one place. 

### The app that I chose to best represent this community is Expedia. (relate to community) 
### Expedia is an online travel agency that can be used to book flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and bundle deals.

## *Expedia App Heuristic Evaluation*

### https://www.expedia.com/app

### Overall, I feel that Expedia provides a relatively straightforward, step-by-step process to plan the user's trip. 
### The main UX issues I found that can be improved are: too much text/overcrowding on the page, too much scrolling, and confusion with final pricing. 

## *1: Visibility of system status
### Shows each step everytime the page loads (step 1: select hotel, step 2: select outbound flight, step 3: select inbound flight)
### Severity rating: 2 (The user is only able to see their progress when they are in-between steps and the next page is loading)

## *2: Match between system and the real world
### Good use of icons
### Severity rating: 1 (Explain why it's good)

## *3: User control and freedom 
### Upper pulldown bar to edit search field
### Once on the final checkout page, the user has to keep clicking the back arrow to change one leg of the flight 
### The user is only able to book airline tickets for a maximum of 6 people
### Severity rating: 2 

## *4: Consistency and standards
### Text or icons in blue are actionable items, red items are used when a feature is not available (non-refundable), green items
