She likes to book package deals that include both her flight and hotel stay.

She relies heavily on guest ratings to help her decision-making process.

She has difficulty comparing all of her options and making a final decision based on the available information on travel websites.

She prefers to use her laptop as she is constantly working on it throughout the day and does not like to keep scrolling on her mobile device.
