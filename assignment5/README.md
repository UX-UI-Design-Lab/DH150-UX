## Scenarios 

*Scenario 1*

Magdalena, an undergraduate college student, is excited to go on a trip with her friends for spring break to celebrate the end of finals. She is looking to book a bundle trip to Cabo, Mexico for 5 people for $300-$400 per person. Magdalena is constantly stressed and overwhelmed with work for her packed course schedule. She and her friends look up deals on their mobile devices and laptops during their study breaks and send screenshots and links to track possible options in their groupchat. Magdalena and her friends are looking for a cost-efficient, all-inclusive deal that fits their budget. They are open and flexible with flights and accomodations. 

Use Case: Magdalena opens her travel app and searches for bundle packages to Cabo for five people between the dates of 3/21 to 3/29. She sorts her search results by price. When she cannot find deals between her price range, she becomes frustrated and edits her search. She changes the travel dates and starts a new search from 3/22 to 3/28 to see if the prices are cheaper. After finding a deal within her price range, she checks out the hotel and selects her inbound and outbound flights. Before proceeding to the checkout page, she takes a screenshot of package summary and sends it to the groupchat.
