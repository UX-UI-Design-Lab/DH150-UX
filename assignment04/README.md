# Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry
DH 150: User Experience Design

## Main Design Challenge 
The main activity that my project would supports is travel planning. How can mobile technology enhance the decision-making challenges of travel booking, while valuing ease of use and cost-effectiveness? How can technology shorten this process?

The basic need involved for this activity is self-actualization. The concept of traveling is to accomplish a goal; such as to explore a new place or visit family or friends.  

The current solution to book travel plans is to meet in person with a travel agent or book directly with the airline and hotel, via their phone line or website. 

The limitations that can possibly be improved with digital technology is the visualization of options, individualized to the user's preferences, such as price point, travel time, and relative location. Additionally, technology can help narrow search choices based on these preferences, to help the user book a trip more efficiently. 

## Target users 
Users are young adults between the ages of 18 to 25 looking for cost-effective travel options. Users travel a couple times a year during the summer and winter and have proficient expertise with travel terms, guidelines, and regulations. 

Users tend to book travel plans in the comfort of their home or living spaces, with friends or family members to communicate options. If alone, users generally utilize communication technology to further dicuss travel options. 

To complete the activity, users first establish a travel destination along with their projected booking dates and travel companions, if any. Using this information, they search for flight and hotel options. Based on their preferences, they further narrow down their options. Once the user agrees upon an option, they proceed to figure out payment details to finalize their itinerary. 

## Observation Method and Plan
Direct interview at participant's home where they would usually conduct searches on their mobile device for travel-related information. The interview process directed the user to search for the average price of hotel in Los Angeles and a last minute flight to San Francisco. I collected user data using pen-paper notes that were later transcribed along with voice reordings.
