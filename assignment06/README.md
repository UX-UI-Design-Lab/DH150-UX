# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Priyana Patel <br/>
DH150: User Experience Design 

## Project Description

The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with travel planning. The target community is a community of travelers that seek adventure, travel to new places, spend time with friends and family, and never feel settled in one place. These users are a group of people with long, drawn-out network ties in multiple cities, countries, and continents looking to explore. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common constraints of travel-planning.

1. Price Tool - suggests what details of your trip to change (such as travel dates, location, airport) in order to fit a designated budget and price range <br/>
2. Minimized Booking Process - compares all airlines and websites and arranges flights by price visibility with personal recommendations, takes user directly to checkout after selecting flights <br/>
3. Recommendation Tool - Summarizes main points of customer reviews, shows highly recommended

Target users value ease of use, previous customer satsifaction, and cost-efficient travel options. Additioanlly, they prefer a desktop travel user experience over a mobile travel user experience. *How can mobile technology enhance the decision-making challenges of travel booking, while valuing ease of use and cost-effectiveness?* User personas were created based on the premise of an undergraduate college student looking for cost-efficient deals to various travel destinations, a young professional searching for last-minute flight deals to visit his significant other, and a freelance designer seeking bundle deals with high-rated accomodations for business trips. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and flow of these features integrated with the current process of booking a trip on a mobile travel app. 

## Tasks

1. Input search field
2. Select an inbound flight
3. Select an outbound flight
4. Select a hotel
5. Pay for and book the trip

## Prototype Testing 

## Reflection 
A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
