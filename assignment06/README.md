# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Priyana Patel <br/>
DH150: User Experience Design 

## Project Description

The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with travel planning. The target community is a community of travelers that seek adventure, travel to new places, spend time with friends and family, and never feel settled in one place. These users are a group of people with long, drawn-out network ties in multiple cities, countries, and continents looking to explore. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common constraints of travel-planning.

1. [Price Tool] - suggests what details of your trip to change (such as travel dates, location, airport) in order to fit a designated budget and price range <br/>
2. [Minimized Booking Process] - compares all airlines and websites and arranges flights by price visibility with personal recommendations, takes user directly to checkout after selecting flights <br/>
3. [Recommendation Tool] - Summarizes main points of customer reviews, shows highly recommended

Target users value ease of use, previous customer satsifaction, and cost-efficient travel options. Additioanlly, they prefer a desktop travel user experience over a mobile travel user experience. *How can mobile technology enhance the decision-making challenges of travel booking, while valuing ease of use and cost-effectiveness?* User personas were created based on the premise of an undergraduate college student looking for cost-efficient deals to various travel destinations, a young professional searching for last-minute flight deals to visit his significant other, and a freelance designer seeking bundle deals with high-rated accomodations for business trips. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and flow of these features integrated with the current process of booking a trip on a mobile travel app. 

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Input search field
2. Select an inbound flight
3. Select an outbound flight
4. Select a hotel
5. Pay for and book the trip 

## Wireframes and Wireflow
![Wireflow Stage 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74673232-b0520980-5163-11ea-8b9e-a3696b4758b9.jpg)

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to search for their bundle trip based on their departure and arrival city or airport, dates of travel, number of travelers, and travel budget (optional). Based on the hotel results, a user can sort or filter the list by hotel name, star rating, and amenities. After clicking on a hotel, a user can view and sort ratings based on their search query and trip purpose. After selecting the room, a user will select an inbound and outbound flight to and from their travel destination. Again, based on their search results, a user has the option to sort or filter flights by duration, stops, time, and airline. After selecting both flights, the user will be directed to a trip summary of their hotel and flight selections. The user has the option to change their selections. If they are satisfied with their selections, the user can proceed to pay for their flight. They will input their passenger and payment details and have the option to insure their trip. Clicking on "Complete Booking" signifies the completion of the travel booking process.  

*Features Description:* The price tool feature takes the user's input from their [travel budget]. If the user clicks on the [Price Tool] button, they will be directed to a new page where they have the option to change their search field to view more cost-efficient price options. For example, changing their departure airport to BUR from LAX. Cheaper flights will help lower the overall cost per person. The minimized flight booking process is reflected in combined flight view. A user is able to select their inbound and outbound flight on the same screen, minimzing scrolling time and directing the user straight to booking. Flights are displayed by [Recommended] as default. The most important flight details are displayed, such as time, airline, flight duration, and price. If the user would like to see more flight details on the airline's website, they can click "See More". The recommendation tool feature is reflected in the hotel search results, displaying the highest recommended hotels on the top of the page. When viewing hotel reviews, the main points of the hotel's average rating are displayed at the top of the screen, such as [cleanliness, service, comfort, condition, and location]. If the user clicks [Sort], they have the option to customize the reviews based on the time of year, traveler type, and keyword in addition to rating and date. 

## Prototype Testing

A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype. did not signify whether they are separate prices. + OR addition. forgot to draw out flow of see more. reset option on all search features.
