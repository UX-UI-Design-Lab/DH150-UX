# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype

DH150: User Experience Design 

## Project Description

The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with travel planning. The target community is a community of travelers that seek adventure, travel to new places, spend time with friends and family, and never feel settled in one place. These users are a group of people with long, drawn-out network ties in multiple cities, countries, and continents looking to explore. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common constraints of travel-planning.

1. **Price Tool** - suggests what details of your trip to change (such as travel dates, location, airport) in order to fit a designated budget and price range <br/>
2. **Minimized Booking Process** - compares all airlines and websites and arranges flights by price visibility with personal recommendations, takes user directly to checkout after selecting flights <br/>
3. **Recommendation Tool** - Summarizes main points of customer reviews, shows highly recommended

Target users value ease of use, previous customer satsifaction, and cost-efficient travel options. Additioanlly, they prefer a desktop travel user experience over a mobile travel user experience. *How can mobile technology enhance the decision-making challenges of travel booking, while valuing ease of use and cost-effectiveness?* User personas were created based on the premise of an undergraduate college student looking for cost-efficient deals to various travel destinations, a young professional searching for last-minute flight deals to visit his significant other, and a freelance designer seeking bundle deals with high-rated accomodations for business trips. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and flow of these features integrated with the current process of booking a trip on a mobile travel app. 

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Input search field
2. Select an inbound flight
3. Select an outbound flight
4. Select a hotel
5. Pay for and book the trip 

## Wireframes and Wireflow
![Wireflow Stage 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74673232-b0520980-5163-11ea-8b9e-a3696b4758b9.jpg)

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to search for their bundle trip based on their departure and arrival city or airport, dates of travel, number of travelers, and travel budget (optional). Based on the hotel results, a user can sort or filter the list by hotel name, star rating, and amenities. After clicking on a hotel, a user can view and sort ratings based on their search query and trip purpose. After selecting the room, a user will select an inbound and outbound flight to and from their travel destination. Again, based on their search results, a user has the option to sort or filter flights by duration, stops, time, and airline. After selecting both flights, the user will be directed to a trip summary of their hotel and flight selections. The user has the option to change their selections. If they are satisfied with their selections, the user can proceed to pay for their flight. They will input their passenger and payment details and have the option to insure their trip. Clicking on "Complete Booking" signifies the completion of the travel booking process.  

*Features Description:* The price tool feature takes the user's input from their **travel budget**. If the user clicks on the **Price Tool** button, they will be directed to a new page where they have the option to change their search field to view more cost-efficient price options. For example, changing their departure airport to BUR from LAX. Cheaper flights will help lower the overall cost per person. The minimized flight booking process is reflected in combined flight view. A user is able to select their inbound and outbound flight on the same screen, minimzing scrolling time and directing the user straight to booking. Flights are displayed by **Recommended** as default. The most important flight details are displayed, such as time, airline, flight duration, and price. If the user would like to see more flight details on the airline's website, they can click "See More". The recommendation tool feature is reflected in the hotel search results, displaying the highest recommended hotels on the top of the page. When viewing hotel reviews, the main points of the hotel's average rating are displayed at the top of the screen, such as **Cleanliness, Service, Comfort, Condition, and Location**. If the user clicks **Sort**, they have the option to customize the reviews based on the time of year, traveler type, and keyword in addition to rating and date. 

## Prototype Testing

### Iteration #1

*Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:* 
The user suprisingly overlooked the dropdown menu frame when mentally going through the search input for flight departure and arrival airport. This makes sense due to the nature of the paper prototype where the airport is already inputted. The user was aware of the city and airport code. This would be interesting to see how helpful the dropdown menu would be for a user who is unaware of their travel destination and surrounding airports. More specifically, which airport do they need to fly into if necessary.

The user was confused about the frame where you can further sort through reviews. Because they did not need to sort further through reviews, there was no need to utilize the tool and feature. When asked what they thought the objective of the process was, they correctly assumed that the feature would help narrow down previous reviews of the hotel. In order to properly test these features, I asked the user to complete the iteration of the wireflow again with the intention of utilizing these features given what they are *supposed to do*. 

### Iteration #2

[picture]

*Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:* 
The user again did not follow the flow to the dropdown menu when inputting the departure and arrival airport. The user was correctly able to navigate the price tool to the page and intepreted that if they changed their departure airport from LAX to BUR, they could lower the price of their trip. Despite this understanding, the user decided to ignore the suggestion and go back to the original results. 

When following the recommendation tool, the user was hesistant to filter and sort by ratings. The feature was intended for the user to select specific ratings, for example, only ratings with a 4/5 and 5/5 rating. With this understanding, the user decided not to sort by rating because she wanted to look at all ratings, regardless of how they scored the hotel. After testing, the user asked me if this was the corret intepreation. Additionally, after pressing **Done**, the user expected to return to the list of reviews. The flow instead returned to the information about the hotel. This was an error on my part in how I designed the flow.  

## Reflection 
I believe the prototype testing went relatively smoothly; the user was successfully able to utilize all intended features despite a few minor setbacks. I was surprised that the layout and organization of my wireframes was intuitive enough for a first-time user. I believe how often a user travels and uses such websites and/or apps does have a little influence in how well they can understand specific terms, such as inbound and outbound. My user travels a couple times a year, both domestically and internationally, and readily uses Expedia as her main travel booking site. I decided to follow Expedia's layout and aesthetics when creating my wireframes.

The tester was confused that the review sort and filter returned to the hotel page when she pressed **Done**. I plan to correct my error and direct the flow back to the list of sorted reviews. The tester was hesistant and unsure whether they had to select a specific rating to sort through the results. I believe this can be solve through design and color when creating my digital prototype. I plan to make these options checkable through checkboxes which are optional in most design aesthetics.
