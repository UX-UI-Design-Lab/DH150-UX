## Introduction 

Expedia is an online travel agency that can be used to book flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and bundle deals.

Usability testing measures, at the minimum, the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a user experience. This process helps us understand how usable a product is. Based on the findings from the heuristic evaluation of the Expedia app, the top three main issues are overcrowding of text on the page (aesthetic and minimalistic design), too much scrolling (user freedom and control), and confusion with fine print details (help and documentation). These issues arise when a user is completing the booking process for a flight or bundle search. To test these issues, we will ask the user to complete a roundtrip and flight and hotel bundle deal from Los Angeles to London. The test will be separated into three tasks of a bundle booking process: flight, hotel, and review/changes.

## Executive Summary
Priyana Patel conducted the test in a lab setting at an apartment on 535 Gayley Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A. on January 20th, 2020. The pilot test video was recording using mobile screen recording feature through iOS screen recording and Windows 10 Camera. The purpose of the usability test aims to find out how to improve the Expedia app from a userâ€™s perspective. This is a pilot test in order to test the setting and the materials. One participant completed three tasks in on session lasting approximately 30 minutes.

Overall, the participant found the Expedia app easy to use and was able to fully complete two out of the three tasks without difficulty and time constraints. The participant found the Expedia app to be calm, familiar, and trustworthy. The test identified minor problems, such as confusing flow between selecting hotels and flights, unclear directions on how to naviagte back and forth and edit search fields, and narrowing search results by price ranges.   

## Methodology

### Session
The usability test consisted of an introduction to the procedure, explanation of informed consent, background questions to check for prior use, pre-test questions, task directions, post-test questions, system usability scale, production satisfaction card, and participant demographics. The following were measured: ease of use, task difficulty, and learnability. The test moderator walked the user through the pre-test, tasks instructions, and post-test. Based on the task scenario, the participant tried to find information and execute the designated task on the app.

### Participant 
Age: 21
Gender: Female
Ethnicity: Arab
English as primary language: Yes

### Evaluation Tasks/Scenarios
The participant attempted to complete the following task:
1. Select and find information about a hotel
2. Select and find information about flights
3. Adjust the trip to lower the overall cost

## Results and Reflection
During the pilot test, I learned that booking a hotel and flight through the bundle feature on the Expedia app are relatively straightforward despite a few difficulties narrowing price ranges. There were issues with user freedom and control when the participant tried to navigated backwards to edit their travel dates and select a new hotel and flights. 

What worked well was screen recording the user's interaction with the Expedia app while also recording their audio as they stated their thoughts, concerns, and inquiries. Some issues that arose were that the app took a while to load search results and a few minor format errors on the usability document. I would like to improve my usability testing in the future by being clear and consise when walking the participant through the process and answering questions. I believe this will help make directions clearer for the participant to complete the usability test to the best of ther ability.
