## Introduction 

###Expedia is an online travel agency that can be used to book flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and bundle deals.

###Usability testing measures, at the minimum, the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a user experience. This process helps us understand how usable a product is. Based on the findings from the heuristic evaluation of the Expedia app, the top three main issues are overcrowding of text on the page (aesthetic and minimalistic design), too much scrolling (user freedom and control), and confusion with fine print details (help and documentation). These issues arise when a user is completing the booking process for a flight or bundle search. To test these issues, we will ask the user to complete a roundtrip and flight and hotel bundle deal from Los Angeles to London. The purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the Expedia app from userâ€™s perspective. The test will be separated into three tasks of a bundle booking process: flight, hotel, and review/changes.
